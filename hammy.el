;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides programmable, interactive interval timers for
;; Emacs.  They can be used, e.g. to alternate between working and
;; resting periods, to remind yourself to stretch your legs, etc.
;; Timers, called "hammys," are easily defined by the user to behave
;; as desired, and they can be integrated into other programs by
;; calling Lisp functions in the hammys' definitions.

;;;; FAQ

;; Q: Why are timers called hammys?  Isn't that silly?

;; A: Probably, but is it sillier than calling them tomatoes?
;; Besides, it helps to distinguish them from Emacs's timers, which
;; are used in the implementation.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Pausing.
;; TODO: Summarize logged interval times.

;;;; Macros

;;;###autoload
(defmacro hammy-define (name &rest args)
  "Define a new Hammy named NAME made with ARGS.
Returns the hammy, and adds hammy to `hammy-hammys'.  NAME is a
string.  ARGS are passed to `make-hammy', which see.  Within
ARGS, these pseudo-functions and forms available:

  `announce (message)': Announce MESSAGE in the echo area.
  `notify (message)`: Send MESSAGE as a desktop notification.

  `do (&rest body)': Expands to a lambda that binds `hammy' to
    the current hammy and evaluates BODY.  Within its BODY, these
    forms are bound:

    `cycles': The number of cycles the hammy has completed.
    `current-duration': The duration in seconds of the current interval.
    `interval': The current interval (a `hammy-interval' struct).
    `interval-name': The name of the current interval."
  (declare (indent defun))
  ;; FIXME: Docstring.
  
  ;; In some ways, it might be preferable for this macro to expand to
  ;; the hammy struct, but then it wouldn't be forward-compatible if
  ;; the structure changes, so we just expand to the code that makes
  ;; the struct.

  ;; NOTE: This macro essentially expands to a call to `make-hammy'
  ;; with the given arguments, wrapping some of them in macrolet,
  ;; symbol-macrolet, and labels forms, and lambdas.  This way, we get
  ;; some checking for free at macro expansion time and compilation
  ;; time, rather than those errors happening at runtime.

  ;; NOTE: If a user byte-compiles a config file containing a
  ;; `hammy-define' call, and the definition of this macro changes in
  ;; a later version, it will be a problem.  So it would be nice if
  ;; this were a function instead of a macro, but that would mean that
  ;; the user would have to quote the argument to prevent evaluation,
  ;; which would likely be confusing to many users.  So, for now, at
  ;; least, it will be a macro.
