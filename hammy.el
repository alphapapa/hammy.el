;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides programmable, interactive interval timers for
;; Emacs.  They can be used, e.g. to alternate between working and
;; resting periods, to remind yourself to stretch your legs, etc.
;; Timers, called "hammys," are easily defined by the user to behave
;; as desired, and they can be integrated into other programs by
;; calling Lisp functions in the hammys' definitions.

;;;; FAQ

;; Q: Why are timers called hammys?  Isn't that silly?

;; A: Probably, but is it sillier than calling them tomatoes?
;; Besides, it helps to distinguish them from Emacs's timers, which
;; are used in the implementation.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Pausing.
;; TODO: Summarize logged interval times.
;; TODO: Menu bar/clicking for mode line lighter.  See `tab-bar-menu-bar', et al.

;;;; Macros

;;;###autoload
(defmacro hammy-define (name &rest args)
  "Define a new Hammy named NAME made with ARGS.
Returns the hammy, and adds hammy to `hammy-hammys'.  NAME is a
string.  ARGS are passed to `make-hammy', which see.  Useful ones
include:

  `:documentation': An optional documentation string.

  `:intervals': A list of intervals.  Each one is defined with
    the local function `interval', which calls
    `make-hammy-interval', which see for its arguments.

  `:before': One or a list of functions which are called when the
    interval begins.  See the `do' macro, documented later.

  `:after': One or a list of functions which are called when the
    interval ends.  See the `do' macro, documented later.

  `:duration': A number of seconds, or a string passed to
    `timer-duration' to return such, or a function which returns
    such (called before starting the interval each cycle).  See
    the `do' macro, documented later.

  `:advance': Nil to advance automatically, or one or a list of
    functions to call when the interval's timer has elapsed and
    the user should be prompted to manually advance to the next
    interval.  See the `do' and `remind' macros, documented
    later.

Within ARGS, these pseudo-functions and forms available:

  `announce (message)': Announce MESSAGE in the echo area.
  `notify (message)`: Send MESSAGE as a desktop notification.

  `climb (from to &key descend step)': Return a function that
    returns a duration gradually increasing from FROM to TO, and
    optionally decreasing back to TO, by STEP.  FROM, TO, and
    STEP may be numbers or strings (passed to `timer-duration',
    which see).  DESCEND, if non-nil, causes the duration to
    gradually decrease back to FROM after reaching TO.

  `duration (interval)': Return a number of seconds equivalent to
    INTERVAL (a string like \"10 minutes\").  Calls
    `timer-duration', which see.

  `do (&rest body)': Expands to a lambda that binds `hammy' to
    the current hammy and evaluates BODY.  Within its BODY, these
    forms are bound:

    `current-duration': The duration in seconds of the current interval.
    `current-interval-start-time': The time at which the current interval began.
    `cycles': The number of cycles the hammy has completed.
    `etc': The hammy's `etc' slot.
    `history': The hammy's history list.
    `interval': The current interval (a `hammy-interval' struct).
    `interval-name': The name of the current interval.

  `elapsed (&optional interval)': Calls `hammy-elapsed' with the
    hammy, which see.

  `interval (&rest args)': Calls `make-hammy-interval', which
    see.

  `num-intervals ()': Returns the hammy's number of intervals.

  `remind (delay &rest fns)': Return a function that is called
    every DELAY seconds until the interval is manually advanced,
    calling FNS each time.  (The function automatically makes
    necessary adjustments to the hammy to set and cancel the
    periodic reminders.)

  `run (command)': Runs COMMAND (a string) asynchronously with
    `make-process', discarding its output and return value."

  ;; In some ways, it might be preferable for this macro to expand to
  ;; the hammy struct, but then it wouldn't be forward-compatible if
  ;; the structure changes, so we just expand to the code that makes
  ;; the struct.

  ;; NOTE: This macro essentially expands to a call to `make-hammy'
  ;; with the given arguments, wrapping some of them in macrolet,
  ;; symbol-macrolet, and labels forms, and lambdas.  This way, we get
  ;; some checking for free at macro expansion time and compilation
  ;; time, rather than those errors happening at runtime.

  ;; NOTE: If a user byte-compiles a config file containing a
  ;; `hammy-define' call, and the definition of this macro changes in
  ;; a later version, it will be a problem.  So it would be nice if
  ;; this were a function instead of a macro, but that would mean that
  ;; the user would have to quote the argument to prevent evaluation,
  ;; which would likely be confusing to many users.  So, for now, at
  ;; least, it will be a macro.
