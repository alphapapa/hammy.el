;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides programmable, interactive interval timers for
;; Emacs.  They can be used, e.g. to alternate between working and
;; resting periods, to remind yourself to stretch your legs, etc.
;; Timers, called "hammys," are easily defined by the user to behave
;; as desired, and they can be integrated into other programs by
;; calling Lisp functions in the hammys' definitions.

;;;; FAQ

;; Q: Why are timers called hammys?  Isn't that silly?

;; A: Probably, but is it sillier than calling them tomatoes?
;; Besides, it helps to distinguish them from Emacs's timers, which
;; are used in the implementation.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Pausing.
;; TODO: Summarize logged interval times.
;; TODO: Menu bar/clicking for mode line lighter.  See `tab-bar-menu-bar', et al.

;;;; Macros

;;;###autoload
(defmacro üêπdefine (name &rest args)
  "Define a new Hammy named NAME made with ARGS.
Returns the ‚è≤, and adds ‚è≤ to `üêπhammys'.  NAME is a
string.  ARGS are passed to `make-hammy', which see.  Useful ones
include:

  `:documentation': An optional documentation string.

  `:intervals': A list of intervals.  Each one is defined with
    the local function `interval', which calls
    `make-üêπinterval', which see for its arguments.

  `:before': One or a list of functions which are called when the
    interval begins.  See the `do' macro, documented later.

  `:after': One or a list of functions which are called when the
    interval ends.  See the `do' macro, documented later.

  `:duration': A number of seconds, or a string passed to
    `timer-duration' to return such, or a function which returns
    such (called before starting the interval each cycle).  See
    the `do' macro, documented later.

  `:advance': Nil to advance automatically, or one or a list of
    functions to call when the interval's timer has elapsed and
    the user should be prompted to manually advance to the next
    interval.  See the `do' and `remind' macros, documented
    later.

Within ARGS, these pseudo-functions and forms available:

  `announce (message)': Announce MESSAGE in the echo area.
  `notify (message)`: Send MESSAGE as a desktop notification.

  `climb (from to &key descend step)': Return a function that
    returns a duration gradually increasing from FROM to TO, and
    optionally decreasing back to TO, by STEP.  FROM, TO, and
    STEP may be numbers or strings (passed to `timer-duration',
    which see).  DESCEND, if non-nil, causes the duration to
    gradually decrease back to FROM after reaching TO.

  `duration (interval)': Return a number of seconds equivalent to
    INTERVAL (a string like \"10 minutes\").  Calls
    `timer-duration', which see.

  `do (&rest body)': Expands to a lambda that binds `‚è≤' to
    the current ‚è≤ and evaluates BODY.  Within its BODY, these
    forms are bound:

    `current-duration': The duration in seconds of the current interval.
    `current-interval-start-time': The time at which the current interval began.
    `cycles': The number of cycles the ‚è≤ has completed.
    `etc': The ‚è≤'s `etc' slot.
    `history': The ‚è≤'s history list.
    `interval': The current interval (a `üêπinterval' struct).
    `interval-name': The name of the current interval.

  `elapsed (&optional interval)': Calls `üêπelapsed' with the
    ‚è≤, which see.

  `interval (&rest args)': Calls `make-üêπinterval', which
    see.

  `num-intervals ()': Returns the ‚è≤'s number of intervals.

  `remind (delay &rest fns)': Return a function that is called
    every DELAY seconds until the interval is manually advanced,
    calling FNS each time.  (The function automatically makes
    necessary adjustments to the ‚è≤ to set and cancel the
    periodic reminders.)

  `run (command)': Runs COMMAND (a string) asynchronously with
    `make-process', discarding its output and return value."

  ;; In some ways, it might be preferable for this macro to expand to
  ;; the ‚è≤ struct, but then it wouldn't be forward-compatible if
  ;; the structure changes, so we just expand to the code that makes
  ;; the struct.

  ;; NOTE: This macro essentially expands to a call to `make-hammy'
  ;; with the given arguments, wrapping some of them in macrolet,
  ;; symbol-macrolet, and labels forms, and lambdas.  This way, we get
  ;; some checking for free at macro expansion time and compilation
  ;; time, rather than those errors happening at runtime.

  ;; NOTE: If a user byte-compiles a config file containing a
  ;; `üêπdefine' call, and the definition of this macro changes in
  ;; a later version, it will be a problem.  So it would be nice if
  ;; this were a function instead of a macro, but that would mean that
  ;; the user would have to quote the argument to prevent evaluation,
  ;; which would likely be confusing to many users.  So, for now, at
  ;; least, it will be a macro.
